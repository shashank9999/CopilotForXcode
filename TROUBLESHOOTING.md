## Extension Permission

GitHub Copilot for Xcode is an Xcode Source Editor extension and requires the
extension to be enabled. In the Copilot for Xcode settings, clicking `Extension
Permission` will open the System Settings to the Extensions page where `GitHub
Copilot` can be enabled under `Xcode Source Editor`.

Or you can navigate to the permission manually depending on your OS version:

| macOS | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| 15 | System Settings > General > Login Items > Extensions > Xcode Source Editor |
| 13 & 14 | System Settings > Privacy & Security  > Extensions > Xcode Source Editor |
| 12 | System Preferences > Extensions |

## Accessibility Permission

GitHub Copilot for Xcode requires the accessibility permission to receive
real-time updates from the active Xcode editor. [The XcodeKit
API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcodekit)
enabled by the Xcode Source Editor extension permission only provides
information when manually triggered by the user. In order to generate
suggestions as you type, the accessibility permission is used to read the
Xcode editor content in real-time.

The accessibility permission is also used to accept suggestions when `tab` is
pressed.

The accessibility permission is __not__ used to read or write to any
applications besides Xcode. There are no granular options for the permission,
but you can audit the usage in this repository: search for `CGEvent` and `AX`*.

Enable in System Settings under `Privacy & Security` > `Accessibility` > 
`GitHub Copilot for Xcode Extension` and turn on the toggle.

## Background Permission

GitHub Copilot for Xcode requires background permission to connect with the host app. This permission ensures proper communication between the components of GitHub Copilot for Xcode, which is essential for its functionality in Xcode.

     <img alt="Background Permission" src="./Docs/background-item.png" width="400" />
</p>

This permission is typically granted automatically when you first launch GitHub Copilot for Xcode. However, if you encounter connection issues, alerts, or errors as follows:

<p align="center">
     <img alt="Alert of Background Permission Required" src="./Docs/background-permission-required.png" width="350" />
     <img alt="Error connecting to the communication bridge" src="./Docs/connect-comm-bridge-failed.png" width="550" />
</p>

Please ensure that this permission is enabled. You can manually navigate to the background permission setting based on your macOS version:

| macOS | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| 15 | System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions > Allow in the Background |
| 13 & 14 | System Settings > General > Login Items > Allow in the Background |

Ensure that "GitHub Copilot for Xcode" is enabled in the list of allowed background items. Without this permission, the extension may not be able to properly communicate with the host app, which can result in inconsistent behavior or reduced functionality.
